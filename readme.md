# Project Name: Backend API for Customer Card Management

## Description:
This project is a backend API developed using .NET Core with an n-tier architecture consisting of API layer, Business layer, and Data layer. The API follows RESTful principles and provides functionality for managing customer cards and related consumptions. Authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) system for secure access to the API endpoints.

## Features:
- RESTful API endpoints for managing customer cards and consumptions
- JWT-based authentication system for secure access
- N-tier architecture for better separation of concerns and maintainability
- SQL Server technology for database storage
- Redis for caching to improve performance
- Seamless integration with a React Native frontend for mobile app development
- Cross-platform support for deploying on iOS and Android

## Components:
1. **API Layer**: Exposes RESTful endpoints for client communication.
2. **Business Layer**: Implements business logic and validation rules.
3. **Data Layer**: Handles data access to the SQL Server database and utilizes Redis for caching.

## Technologies Used:
- .NET Core
- SQL Server
- Redis
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- React Native

## Setup:
1. Clone the repository from [GitHub Repo URL].
2. Ensure you have .NET Core SDK installed on your machine.
3. Set up a SQL Server instance and update the connection string in the configuration files.
4. Install Redis and configure caching settings accordingly.
5. Run the necessary database migrations to set up the schema.
6. Build and run the backend API.
7. Integrate the API endpoints into your React Native frontend for seamless communication.

## Usage:
1. Register/Login users to obtain JWT tokens.
2. Use the obtained JWT tokens to authenticate subsequent API requests.
3. Manage customer cards and related consumptions through the provided API endpoints.
4. Leverage Redis caching for improved performance where applicable.
5. Integrate the API with your React Native frontend for a complete mobile app solution.
